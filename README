Chargify API wrapper for the Django framework
django_chargify

This is a Django wrapper for the Chargify API which requires pychargify (it actually includes it as I have made some alterations to include coupons). 
It allows you to interface with the Chargify API by just creating and manipulating standard model objects. 

Installation
Place this library on your python path
Add "django_chargify" to your installed apps
Modify the chargify_settings_config.py to include your Chargify info
migrate your database


Requirements
pychargify
django
